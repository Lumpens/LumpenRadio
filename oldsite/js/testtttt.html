                        FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
                        <h1>LUMPEN RADIO IS HERE.</h1>
                        <p>
                        Public Media Institute is a grass roots arts and media non
    profit organization based in Chicago. PMI’s mission is to
    create, incubate and sustain innovative cultural programming
    through the production of socially engaged projects, festivals,
    spaces, exhibitions, and media.
    In the past 14 years, PMI has published the art and culture
    magazines, Lumpen and Proximity, as well as Mash Tun Journal,
    Materiél magazine and The Bridgeport International. PMI also
    programs the Co-Prosperity Sphere, an experimental cultural
    center based in Bridgeport, that hosts exhibitions, talks
    and events. PMI has been celebrated as creating some of the
    most innovative arts programming in the midwest, as well as
    running one of the most popular independent art galleries in
    Chicago. It’s publications are critically acclaimed, award
    winning, and part of the city’s media diet. Because of this
    success we have been awarded a new challenge in the form of
    a radio station.</p>
