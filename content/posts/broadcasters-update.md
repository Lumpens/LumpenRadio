Since we went on the FM dial five months ago, Lumpen radio has grown steadily. Thanks to the amazing volunteers and visionaries we have among us, we now present 25-30 hours of community talk each week, covering everything from local politics and local weirdos to vegetables, technology and activism. We air hundreds of hours each week of curated music, which veers from breakfast-time soul and funk to psychomagical freakouts in the evening. We are truly blessed to be able to present such a vibrant, wonderful and magical mix to the local community. The family that now surrounds Lumpen Radio humbles us with their spirit and energy.

One person has been at the center of the Lumpen Radio family since the very start: Logan Bay. It’s not an exaggeration to say that without Logan’s hard work, patience and incredible passion for Lumpen Radio, none of us would be here. Logan helped us achieve all of this. And right now, Logan needs our help.

On March 24, Logan was injured in a freak accident in our Bridgeport neighborhood. He was hit and pinned by a car when he was unloading equipment from a neighborhood event, and he is now in hospital. Logan lost part of his right leg in the accident, as well as part of his left foot. He faces a long recovery.  Logan being Logan, he has been unrelentingly positive and cheerful – and he is still programming our station from his hospital bed.

Logan will need assistance with the incredible number of bills that come with a major accident. Lumpen Radio has set up a fund drive on YouCaring.com. If you can donate to help him, please do: {{< ext "youcaring.com/loganbay-789765" "https://www.youcaring.com/loganbay-789765" />}}. Logan has given us so much – please give back to him and his family during this difficult time.

If you have any questions, drop by the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Our studio doors are often open, and we have two exhibits this month. Up through Friday April 14 is a series of photographs documenting a 1980 show performed by the Ramones; following that the Bridgeport All-Stars will roar into the space with a madcap display of artwork made right here in the Community of the Future. That opens at noon on April 21st, and will be up through April 30. Stop by for a snack, pet DJ Dash, and check in with Ed, Jamie or Hannah. We are located at {{< location >}}. Thanks for reading. Thanks for listening. Thanks for helping Logan.
