We’re finally settling in to the fact that things are just getting weirder every day. And this weirdness has inspired an intense flurry of activity here in the Community of the Future.

The Orange One has brought a sense of urgency to our little corner of the world. That has motivated us to provide our listeners with local perspectives on the developing Trump Residency. We know it’s very hard trying to understand the political strife and chaos unfolding daily, and the fact is this ongoing crisis has shattered all the normal diagnostic tools we use to understand what is going on. So we are doing our best to filter out the noise and bring to light some of the issues that affect our communities.

We keep up with the headlines every week day during Jamie Trecker’s daily drivetime news segments (7-8 am and 4-6 pm, Monday-Friday) and we are very pleased to air Democracy Now every week day morning at 8pm for some hard-hitting analysis of the day’s events.

We also have a lot of provocative, compelling talk programming on WLPN-LP. We collect the highlights every week on a new show called Lumpen Week in Review. This show usually includes clips of interviews with awesome guests, a Trump Diary, and the other highlights from the week. You can subscribe to the podcast in {{< ext "iTunes" "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1209773755" />}} or listen on {{< ext "mixcloud.com/lumpenradio" "https://www.mixcloud.com/lumpenradio" />}}. {{< ext "Last week" "https://www.mixcloud.com/lumpenradio/lumpen-week-in-review-3-3-17" />}} we presented a great sampling of guests featured on the station: Chicago Teacher’s Union President, Karen Lewis, as well as acclaimed author Irvine Welsh, Don DeGrazia and Kristina Golden.

We also know you are unable to tune in to every DJ, and every talk show on WLPN-LP, so we have tried to do a good job of archiving shows that we think rock on mixcloud. Check in to listen to some worthwhile talk shows and mixes from our bad ass DJs: {{< ext "mixcloud.com/lumpenradio" "https://mixcloud.com/lumpenradio" />}}

One of the best things about being around Lumpen Radio is that we get to meet amazing artists, freaks, cultural workers, activists, authors, musicians, and kooks and professionals of all stripes. The flurry of activity, the diversity of programming, the just plain old sick DJs that play psychomagical sounds, has magnified and connected us to so many communities that it makes us feel so proud and so lucky to be part of something this rad.

We want to hug all of our Lumpen Radio colleagues and their guests for making this possible, especially Logan Bay, Jamie Trecker, and Hannah Larson for keeping this ship running. It is super hard doing what they do every single day. We should all send them cookies, weed, and beer. Or in Logan's case, fantasy board games.

We hope you will join us on this worthwhile endeavor. At the end of this month we are going to start our very first Membership Drive instead of doing the occasional Swag-A-Thon. We are going to ask you to become an annual member of Lumpen Radio! Becoming a member will help us sustain our operations, make more programs that kick ass and bring Low Power Radio to the People! Details about the Drive will be sent to you soon. In the meantime we will be working on our website to make it more mobile friendly and changing up a few things so we can kick some serious ass in 2017.

If you ever wanted to stop by and check out our HQ please consider dropping in during one of our exhibitions. A new show opens Friday, March 10 from 6-9pm, as a trio of Danish artists will transform our studio into a playground/labor camp for domestic robots. The show, called Nature Go Home, will definitely be a weird one. Stop by for some snacks, pet DJ Dash, and let us know how you think we are doing.  We are located at Co-Prosperity Sphere, {{< ext "3219 S Morgan St" "https://goo.gl/maps/qTiWJhG2TYJ2" />}}, Chicago IL 60608.

Thanks for reading. Thanks for listening. See you all on campus.
