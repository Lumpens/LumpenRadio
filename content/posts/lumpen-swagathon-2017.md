We need your support to stay on the air and we’ve got some new fresh gear!

We grew a lot in the last year and its thanks to everyone for joining in on this audio-community project together. We need your help to keep growing!

If you like what we are adding to the airwaves in Chicago & beyond, please consider buying some swag. All the proceeds will go towards paying for the radio and studio engineering work that keeps us on the air.

We’ll only be offering this swag for the next two weeks, so check it out today.
