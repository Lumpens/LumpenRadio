Starting and sustaining a Low Power Radio Station takes a lot of work! But with hundreds of volunteers and a very small staff we have managed to make WLPN-LP 105.5 FM one of Chicago’s raddest radio stations. With your financial support we can keep hosting our great DJs and talk shows and ultimately expand our programming.

The Spring Swag-A-Thon will help cover our long-awaited engineering bills. If you like what we are adding to the public airwaves in Chicago then please consider buying some swag. All the proceeds will go towards paying our radio and studio engineering bills — and keep us on the air.
