Hello everyone out there!

Thank you for sticking with us as we’ve continued to grow!

We especially want to thank everyone who participated in Lumpen’s Spring g us to keep beaming our psychomagical programming into homes around Chicago and the rest of the world. Friends like you have helped make this little community radio station a reality, and your support means the world to us.

The funding we collected helps us program over 40 hours a week of talk. Plus, we’ve got more shows coming on line later this year. Our shows cover the gamut from politics and art, to beer, sports, mysticism and technology. It also allows us to continue our wonderful partnership with {{< ext "Yollocalli" "http://yollocalli.org/" />}} that gives kids real hand-on radio experience. We also program hundreds of hours of music from some of the best curators and DJs in Chicago and beyond. Funding also helps us keep sending our signal out on 105.5FM, which gives us the chance the reach our beautiful city. There’s much more to come from WLPN-LP this year, thanks to your help and generosity, so stay tuned.

If you didn’t have the chance to support us in the {{< ext "Swagathon" "http://lumpenradio.bigcartel.com/" />}}, you can always show your love by sharing your favorite shows with your friends, colleagues, neighbors, water taxi captains or anyone who might not know about us yet. Send em to our website or tune their radios to 105.5FM.

Once again, from all of us in the Community of the Future, thank you for supporting Lumpen Radio!
