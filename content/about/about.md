### About Us

Lumpen Radio, WLPN-LP, is Chicago’s newest FM radio station. WLPN-LP is operated by a community of curators, producers and DJs working to connect you with the music and ideas we think you will love. Our aim is to spotlight the hidden parts of the city, amplifying its voices and sounds. We’re here to promote an open media, unite communities, and magnify the hard work of artists, musicians, activists and cultural workers like you.  

WLPN is a project of [Public Media Institute](http://www.publicmediainstitute.com) (PMI). PMI is a non-profit 501(c) 3, community based, art & culture organization located in the neighborhood of Bridgeport in the city of Chicago. PMI’s mission is to create, incubate, and sustain innovative cultural programming through the production of socially engaged projects, festivals, spaces, exhibitions, and media.  

This program is partially supported by a grant from the Illinois Arts Council Agency.
