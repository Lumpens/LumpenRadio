### ABOUT

“The Don’t Call Me Sweetheart! Show” is the sound of Pop Rocks spiraling down your ear canal and lodging in your brain. Award winning creators Stephen Sonneveld and Andrew Gregory Krzak resurrect the long dormant conventions of the radio play, mix them with equal parts satire, drama, humor and pathos, and then throw in a touch of audio verite. This concoction is then peppered with texture and slathered with cadence before it is left to cure in the sizzle of your amplifier. Disregarding everything they learned in mime school, Sonneveld and Krzak create something that is dialed in halfway between an SOS signal from the Bermuda Triangle and a love poem written on the wind.
