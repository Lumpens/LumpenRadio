### BIO

Lyra Hill is a multidisciplinary artist, educator, and organizer based in Chicago, who exhibits and performs expanded interpretations of her film and comix work internationally. She founded and organized the performative-comix reading series Brain Frame from 2011-2014. Lyra's life purpose is to surprise people with the depth of their own emotional experiences.

### MAGIC CHATS

Magic Chats is a weekly interview show hosted by Lyra Hill. Each week, a different guest brings in a variety of sounds that move them. We listen together, and then chat about it. Each episode of Magic Chats opens with a listener-submitted Magic Moment, and concludes with the Mystery of the Week. Listeners are encouraged to write in to magic.chats@gmail.com and help solve the Mystery! Magic Chats theme and effects created by Tyson Torstensen.
