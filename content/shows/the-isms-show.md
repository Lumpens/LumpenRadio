### BIO

Betty Heredia is a Chicago artist who writes & illustrates her own comics. Her paintings and drawings are inspired by music, and can be found on display at various venues across the city and suburbs.

### THE ISMS SHOW

Airs: Second and Fourth Mondays from 4-6PM

DJ sets played at weird speeds and odd combinations with an emphasis on hip hop instrumentals, spoken word, jazz, and international music. Special guests are invited to share their isms- music and life philosophies. Beats and vibes from the past, present, and future.
