### THE EIGHTIES HOUR

The Eighties Hour is a rebroadcast of the music that complemented an age of disruptive technologies, new economies, right wing politics, and MTV. This soundtrack to the Beginning of the End Days is a mash up of New Wave, Post Punk, Synth Pop, and New Romantic sounds that pushed the boundaries of electronic music.
