### BIO

Bobby Conn is the internationally recognized developer of the "Continuous Ca$h Flow System" and a seasonal entertainer based in Chicago and Boca Raton, FL. DJ LeDeuce invented "16 Style" in the early 1990's and things have only gotten slower since then. LeDeuce and Bobby are founding members of Chicago mind fuck pioneers Condeucent and love each other very much.

### POST MODERN TALKING

Cheri Cheri Lady! What happens when our culture implodes and all that's left is a bunch of vinyl, some microphones and a delay pedal? Oh, we have a lap-top too. Semi-erotic semiotic surprises.
