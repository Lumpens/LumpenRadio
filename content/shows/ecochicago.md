### BIO

Hayley Fager brings her passion for urban farming and good food to EcoNews. She runs the International Network for Urban Ag, a nonprofit that educates, advocates for, and provides funding to urban farmers worldwide. She's also a butcher and a ski bum, and will try not to laugh too loud into the mic.

### ECOCHICAGO
