### ABOUT

Radius presents PATCH, an ongoing series of curated playlists originally produced for the Free Music Archive, an interactive library of high-quality, legal audio downloads directed by WFMU.

{{< ext "PATCH" "http://theradius.us/patch" />}} is a series of curated playlists selected from the Radius episode archive. Each playlist is organized around a specific topic or theme that engages the tonal and public spaces of the electromagnetic spectrum. PATCH serves as a platform to illuminate the questions, concerns, and complexities of and within radio-based art practices.
