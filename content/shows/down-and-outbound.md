### BIO

Daniel Van Duerm is a multi-disciplinary audio artist based in Chicago. Delving into improvised music, composition, producing, engineering and production he is always pissing someone off with loud noise. While attending college in Chicago he regularly attended experimental jazz shows where he developed a taste for the out. He now plays regularly with the people he once only listened to.
