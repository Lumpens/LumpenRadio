### FUTURE PAST MUSIC

"Humanoid DJâ€™s RikShaw and LeDeuce combine their decades worth of mutant musical knowledge and DJ experience in order to broadcast to you a distress signal from the future. Transmitting  from the time of cassettes, Betamax, and rotating sonic vinyl petroleum products. They send their warning in the cipher of the sub-genres you now refer to as cold wave, dark wave, and new wave, from a time when all of these so called genres were proto.  A warning to the post-apocalyptic internet wastelands of the future that we have seen the past." - George Orwell circa 1985
