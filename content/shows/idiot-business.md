### BIO

Mike Esposito has been DJing electronic music since 1995. He got his start in Boston, specializing in jungle, IDM, and experimental music. He hosted the “Idiot Business” radio show on WZBC in the Boston area from 2000-2004, specializing in experimental electronic music of all kinds. He also developed his own "manic illbient" performance style, which was a ferocious mix of noise, harsh beats, and sound collage that he performed at gigs in the early 2000s.  Now living in Chicago, he continues to record DJ mixes as DJ Blanketforts. His DJ style has been refined a bit since the manic illbient years, maintaining the eclecticism and soundclash, but with renewed emphasis on continuity in the mix. However, with influences from rave to jungle to experimental to rock to hip hop and more, the one constant of Mike’s mixes is that there are no constants.

### IDIOT BUSINESS

Experimental electronic music of all kinds.
