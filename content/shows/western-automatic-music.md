### WESTERN AUTOMATIC MUSIC

Airs: Every Monday from 12-2PM

Western Automatic Music hears the phantom sounds that hang in the air from the ghosts of bright red radios, all the hits from all the charts, they pass our corner and linger in the air mixing with the tinny reverb funneled thru small burnt transistors... Western Automatic Music is the sound of sinners all over the world falling to their knees. Western Automatic Music is like Chicago itself: huge, filthy, and mean.
