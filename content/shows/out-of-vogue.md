### BIO

Ian Wise is an anti social freak that probably shouldn't be allowed on the radio. As current curator of Foreign Legion Records, Wise scours the earth for obscure punk ragers from around the world so you don't have to (like you would anyway). He's DJed parties and bars all over Chicago, lugging around white boxes full of records that you've never heard of but will soon be telling your friends you've "always been into." He was a longtime contributor to the world-famous punk magazine Razorcake and even published several issues of his own stupid zine called Our Way of Life that you may have picked up off a merch table at one point only to set it down and immediately forget having ever seen it. He has short hair, is uptight and humorless, and will annoy you via 105.5 on a monthly basis.
