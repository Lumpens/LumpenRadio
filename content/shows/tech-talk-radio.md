### TECH TALK RADIO

Tech Scene Chicago is an independently produced talk radio show produced by [Tech Month Chicago](https://www.techmonthchicago.com/) and hosted by Melanie Adcock.

Tech Scene Chicago serves as a subsidiary entity of Tech Month Chicago (a non-profit organization) to help further their mission of advocacy awareness and outreach of S.T.E.A.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering. Arts, and Mathematics) throughout the city of Chicago.
