### BIO

Sonorama is a Chicago-based DJ collective that is known for energizing dance floors and sound waves with a unique blend of vintage Latin sounds. Founded in 2010 by Charly Garcia and brothers Edgar and Marlowe Baca, Sonorama is a group of insatiable diggers and lovers of musÂ­ic on vinyl. In early 2015 the trio launched the debut of Sonorama Discos, marking their interest in seeking and releasing contemporary bands and music with similar leanings to Latin America's sonic past and an ear for fresh approaches to that tradition. When the guys aren't busy DJing an event, you can catch their selections via podcasts, the occasional playlist or you might just run into them at your local record store.

### SONORAMA
