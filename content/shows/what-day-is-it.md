### BIO
Paul bought his first tape when he was 6: Michael Jackson "Thriller". Since that day, he has collected hundreds of tapes, CDs, records and mp3s. Music is his obsession. After leaving New Jersey, the land of WFMU, he moved to Chicago in 1997. He has a music degree from DePaul University and plays saxophone, guitar, baritone guitar, bass and keyboards. Paul is a full-time employee at Laurie's Planet Of Sound. He is also the longest-standing intern at Thrill Jockey Records. Somehow he still has time and energy to dedicate to the world of audio collage and a passion for freeform radio.


### WHAT DAY IS IT?

In order to explain, embrace, explore, exacerbate and enhance our innate human desire to alter our consciousness, “What Day Is It?” will present the listener with an earful of not only the groovinest psychedelic tuneskis, but also an all-encompassing psychedelic radio program experience: a truly mind-altering twist on what radio is from a truly mind-altered mind. By taking the listener on a completely different type of ride each week, the destinations are truly limitless. Playlists will range from Oud music to Hawkwind, Terry Riley to Bitchin’ Bajas, country hits and sampled bits.
