### DIVISIVE

Divisive is a two-hour monthly broadcast on Lumpen Radio created by Keith Brown, Leah Gipson and Craig Harshaw that explores controversial issues related to cultural work, activism and social life. The Merriam Webster dictionary definition of the word Divisive is “causing a lot of disagreement between people and causing them to separate into different groups”. The new show centers difficult and divisive conversations as central to all struggles for human liberation and environmental sanity. Democratic conversations are inherently ridden with discord and disagreement. It is time to stop hiding our heads in the sands of banality and false consensus. It is time to become divisive.
