### THE BUTTER HOURS

In lieu of the Michael Thomas Thomas Michael Show, in which hosts Michael Thomas and Thomas Michael have never once shown up to do a show, Scott and Eric have stepped in with their own show, The Butter Hours. The two long-time friends wax ridiculous on a wide variety of topics and conversational threads. Included in the show are music selections hand-picked by the duo for your curious ears to ponder and process.
