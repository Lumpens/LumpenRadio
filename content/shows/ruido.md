### BIO

I was born and raised in Mexico City in a very European household. As a mestizo, I didn’t feel like I fitted in anywhere, but I was lucky to be born into a family that loved music and were active promoters of it. Music became a bridge to the universe. I do a lot of research on Latin American Post-Punk and other sounds being created by fellow subversive types (designers, journalists, producers, writers, conceptual artists, filmmakers, psychologists, architects, musicians and non-musicians). As a weekly show, this program would dig deep into the roots of Latin American Psychedelia and follow its aesthetic, cultural, spiritual and political evolution into Post-Punk.


### RUIDO

Mexico City expat living in Chicago, Gabriel has been obsessed with music since childhood, with a particular focus in International Pop, Standards, Classical, Soul, Now Sound, Psychedelia, Canción Popular Mexicana, Italo Disco, British Invasion, Kosmische Musik, Synth Film Scores, Avant Garde, Tropicalia, Post-Punk, Electronic, etc. etc. (organized noises in general). As an art-school kid, he began making mixtapes of Latin American Post-Punk to share with his music lovin' classmates and has not stopped ever since. He's part of the RSA Group, a small collective of Mexican DJ's, Producers, Promoters, Writers, Artists and Filmmakers led by Eduardo Calvillo (aka Resistol 5000). For the past 20 years, they have been exploring the roots and history of Latin Psychedelia and promoting shows all over Chicago, from church basements in the South Side to venues such as Metro, Double Door, and the now defunct Congress Theater and HotHouse.
